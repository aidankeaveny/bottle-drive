/**
 * Contains REST controllers for handling HTTP requests and responses
 * in the CRUD backend application.
 * <p>
 * This package includes controllers that define RESTful endpoints
 * for managing resources in the application. Controllers
 * handle HTTP requests, interact with service layers, and
 * return appropriate responses to clients.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, this package includes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link com.aidan.crud_backend.controller.UserController} -
 *     Manages user-related operations including creating,
 *     retrieving, updating, and deleting user records.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Additional controllers for other resources and
 * functionalities may be added as the application expands.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 1.0
