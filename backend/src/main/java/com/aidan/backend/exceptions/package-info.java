/**
 * Contains custom exception classes for the CRUD backend application.
 * <p>
 * This package includes exceptions that are used to handle
 * specific error conditions in the application. Custom
 * exceptions provide a way to encapsulate error details and
 * convey meaningful error messages or status codes to
 * clients or to other parts of the application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, this package includes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link com.aidan.backend.exceptions.ResourceNotFoundException} -
 *     Indicates that a requested resource was not found in the
 *     application.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Additional custom exceptions for other error scenarios
 * and conditions may be added as the
 * application requirements evolve.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 1.0
