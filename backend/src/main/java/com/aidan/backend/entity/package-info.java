/**
 * Contains JPA entity classes for the backend application.
 * <p>
 * This package includes classes that represent entities in the
 * application and are mapped to database tables.
 * Each entity class typically corresponds
 * to a table in the database and defines the attributes and
 * relationships of that table.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, this package includes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link com.aidan.backend.entity.User} -
 *     Represents a user in the application with attributes such as ID,
 *     first name, last name, and email.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Additional entity classes for other database tables a
 * nd relationships may be added as the application
 * evolves.
 * </p>

 * @since 1.0
