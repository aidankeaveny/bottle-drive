/**
 * Contains Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for the CRUD backend application.
 * <p>
 * This package includes DTOs that are used to transfer data between different
 * layers of the application, such as between the service layer
 * and the web layer. DTOs encapsulate the data in a format that is
 * suitable for API responses, service interactions, and data exchange.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, the package includes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link com.aidan.backend.dto.UserDto} -
 *     Represents user information, including ID, first name,
 *     last name, and email.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Additional DTOs for other entities and purposes may be added in the future
 * as the application evolves.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 1.0
