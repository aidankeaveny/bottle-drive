/**
 * Contains service interfaces for business logic and
 * operations in the CRUD backend application.
 * <p>
 * This package includes interfaces that define the business
 * logic and service operations for different entities
 * in the application. Service interfaces provide a
 * contract for service implementation and facilitate
 * interactions between the controller and repository layers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, this package includes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link com.aidan.crud_backend.service.UserService} -
 *     Defines service methods for managing
 *     {@link com.aidan.crud_backend.dto.UserDto} objects,
 *     including CRUD operations and business logic.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Additional service interfaces for other entities and
 * business operations may be added as the application evolves.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 1.0
